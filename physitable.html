			Introduction
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">
				Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. There is no known
				cure for CP and as such it is lifelong condition. Children with cerebral palsy experience limitations in gross and fine motor control, strength, and range of motion. Muscle imbalance and poor control of movement can have an impact on the daily occupational
				functioning of children with cerebral palsy.

			Background
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">
				Physical therapy is a branch of rehabilitative health that is considered one of the most important aspects of treating children with cerebral palsy focusing on stretching and strengthening of muscles. As with any therapy, success largely depends upon
				the dedication of the patient and his/her motivation to actively take part in the physical exercises. Children get more engaged and motivated through a game environment and they tend to forget the pain caused by and the dull repetitive nature of rehabilitation
				exercises.

			Research
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the study began with a few subject matter expert (SME) interviews to get in-depth knowledge of this field and validate the presumptions made through literature review. Second study included
				contextual user research to gather qualitative data about the physiotherapies, exercises and equipment being used for rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy and their limitations. Four children with cerebral palsy, with all having different
				levels of abilities were studied and keenly observed during their physiotherapy session in Shishu Sarothi. Research findings from contextual inquiry were as:<br></p>

		<div class="process_text">
			<ul>
				<li> Equipment being used in the physical rehabilitation center of Shishu Sarothi are very conventional and involve no technological interventions.</li>
				<li> Most of the physiotherapy equipment are focused on gross motor skill development and there are very few equipment available for fine motor skill development (grasping, supination of wrist, extension of the fingers etc).</li>
				<li> For fine motor skill development they use manual and passive therapy techniques. For example, for improving the wrist movement and rotation children are made to open the cap of a bottle.</li>
				<li>A child do all the exercises and therapies under the supervision of therapist or caretaker. Children look forward to spending time with the therapist. </li>
				<li>While doing any activity children do not focus their attention on the activity instead get distracted easily by their environment.</li>
				<li>To motivate a child and engage their attention on the activity, therapists talk to them and give them feedbacks continuously.</li>

			<p class="project-text-para">Three physiotherapists working in physical rehabilitation at the Shishu Sarothi were interviewed to obtain insight into criteria that technology should meet to be useful and usable in assisting fine and motor skills training in children with cerebral
				palsy. The design of the final solution is based on the physiotherapists' knowledge and observations about their patients. The following research hypotheses were formed on the basis of those interviews:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						H1: Audio and visual feedbacks such as sound effects or bright colors and lights engages children's attention and keep them motivated, although sound effects are more helpful at the end of each game.</li>
					<li>H2: Progress feedback for completing the exercises will motivate the child to repeat the exercise.</li>
					<li>H3: Gradually increasing the difficulty of the game will accelerate rehabilitation.</li>
					<li>H4: The simple and uniform use of colors as visual feedback/instructions will help to focus attention.</li>

			Design
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">
				Our research findings suggested that Shishu Sarothi lack equipments for development of fine motor skills. We decided to help by proposing the use of PhysiTable, a programmable electronic board game involving tangible and tactile interactions, along with
				audio and visual feedback to train several movements, such as grasping, supination of wrist, extension of the fingers, and movement of the shoulder. Along with improving the motor skills, the proposed system improves eye-hand co-ordination and cognitive
				skill of the children. Lastly, the therapists are able to control the level of difficulty of the games, which would help in mapping child's improvement.
			</p>
			<h5> Components</h5>
			<p class="project-text-para">
				Components of the system includes one tracing cube, three rotating cube and a board which has three paths built on it. Paths are like train rails and child is expected to move the cube on the rails. Led strips are attached beneath each path which glows
				on the basis of levels that the child needs to practice. When tracing cube is brought in contact with the paths it will glow with same color as that of path. Rotating cube is attached to the board whereas tracing cube is free. There are three types
				of path. First is blue path with only one turn. Second is red path with two turn. Third is Green with zig zag motion.

			<h5> Working of physiotherapy</h5>
			<p class="project-text-para">
				Child is first asked to rotate the Rotating cubes and stop when the color of the rotating cube is same as color that of the path. Child is then asked to move the cube on the path which is glowing. As soon as the child put the cube on the rail, cube starts
				glowing with the same color as that of path and a pleasant sound starts coming. If the child is able to move the tracing cube on the path without slipping the cube out of the path then the light and sound keeps on going. When the cube dislocates from
				the path the tracing cube stops glowing and the sound also stops playing. Child has to put the tracing cube back on the rail and complete the path. Basic Red, Green and Blue color has been used for the paths.
			</p>
			<h5> Levels of challenges</h5>
			<p class="project-text-para">
				First the child will be asked to go for first type of path. As soon as he gets acquainted with that he would be asked to practice with second and third path. After this at fourth level he will have all the three paths glowing and therapist or the caretaker
				will only specify the color and the child has to follow that path.

			Prototype
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">
				The prototype was evaluated in an initial qualitative study with therapists to assess the potential of PhysiTable in daily Physical rehabilitation practice. In this stage, the therapist decides to what extent the system fulfills the needs of the target
				patients. This approach contributes in finding the right balance between initial technology and exploration with therapists. We included two therapists treating children with CP, in Shishu Sorathi for the evaluation of the system. After shortly explaining
				the interactions and game play, each therapist played with our prototypes. During and after playing with each prototype, the therapists explained their vision and opinion on our system and discussed with each other and with the researchers. </p>

			<p class="project-para-text">Overall, the therapists were very positive and enthusiastic about the PhysiTable as tangible training system. They enjoy exercising with our cubes and declare that the cubes provided a lot of variation possibilities for physical training. They stated
				that these cubes offered many possibilities for physical rehabilitation, and that they would definitely use our System for their patients once it is proven to be effective.

			Evaluation
		</div>
		<div class="process_text">
			<p class="project-text-para">
				First hand evaluation of the first phase prototype was conducted in nearby areas of Guwahati with children suffering from cerebral Palsy falling in the age group of 6-14 years. Evaluation was done in presence of 2 physiotherapists from Shishu Sarothi
				School. Following are the Evaluation outcomes:
				<ul>
					<li> Constraint Required: Children suffering from high mental retardation needs constraints on either the edges or in between the rails to make sure they are able to do the task at first. After practice constraints can be removed to learn further and
						also to make it accessible for others who are not suffering from mental retardation.</li>
					<li>Engaging System: Kids use to keep the cube stationary at the end of the path if it was glowing and if cube got out of the track and stopped glowing he would go to the start because from experience he learnt that it works at the starting point and
						he was doing this repeatedly.</li>
					<li>Enjoyable Experience: Kids were smiling all the time they were working with this tangible board.</li>
					<li>Aesthetics: About the appearance, physiotherapist suggested not to add too many colors because that might distract children's attention. They commented that the plain looking is working well and lights and sounds are good enough to engage kids.</li>
					<li>Grasping: The size of the graspable cube was perfect enough for providing a good grip but the size of the rotating cube was slightly big. Children were feeling difficulty in rotating the cube because of the poor grip.</li>
