        Overview
      </div>
      <div class="process_text">
        <p class="project-text-para">
          Amazon is a worldwide leader for E-commerce business. Their hardcore customer centric approach towards design makes them truly stand to their first principle of ‘Customer Obsession’. Amazon’s checkout process is one such example of great UX which is often
          mentioned as benchmark for best checkout flow.
          <br> I worked on ‘Address capture mechanism’ in checkout process. It was a challenging task to improve the already benchmarked system within given time frame and technical constraints.
        </p>
        <h5 class="process_title_sec"> My Role and Responsibilities</h5>
        <p class="project-text-para">
          I was responsible for making address capture mechanism more effective and user friendly. I worked alongside my mentor and manager.
          <br> Core responsibilities included usability analysis of competitors’ address capture pages, user (within Amazon) and process research, coming out with problem areas and creating wireframes for web media.

        <h5 class="process_title_sec">Confidentiality Clause and Release</h5>
        <p class="project-text-para">
          To comply with Amazon’s confidentiality clauses, I have restricted explanations and visuals in few sections, particularly final mockups and prototype. Few of proposed changes got approved and went for development and rest were kept for future developments.

      The Challenge
    </div>
    <div class="process_text">
      <p class="project-text-para">
        Amazon has always been the frontrunner in creating best experience for checkout flow. Their boldness can be seen by the fact that they have removed hyperlinks from header logo and created one way flow to increase conversions. Vital chunk of checkout journey
        lies in capturing the right address to which order has to be delivered. Though Amazon optimises and corrects wrong written addresses in the backend, but still its losses are mounting which is also because of wrong address problems.

        <p class="project-text-para" style="padding-top: 50px;">
          The initial problem statement synthesised was:
        </p>
        <p class="text-focus">
          "To find problems and design an experience that would allow customers provide the 'Address' information accurately, to make the delivery process efficient and minimise losses."

      The Approach
    </div>
    <div class="process_text">
      <p class="project-text-para">
        Constraints in timeframe lead me to take the lean approach. I quickly created assumptions and hypothesises which eventually got validated/invalidated based on actual user interviews. This saved a considerable amount of time for me.<br> Overview
        of full process:

      Discovery/Research

    <div class="process_text">
      <p class="project-text-para">I went a step back and started my discovery phase by going through lifecycle of an order. I studied about steps that goes in between order placement and product delivery. Below infographic illustrates the process briefly.

    <div class="process_text">
      <p class="project-text-para">This helped me to understand problem areas throughout order lifecycle that results in either erroneous or no delivery. Further insights were added through stake holder interviews of Product Managers and designers working in ‘Amazon’s transport’
        teams. Study of process coupled with stakeholder interviews further shaped my understanding on the type and magnitude of losses that Amazon suffers.
      </p>
      <p class="project-text-para">The process study was followed by remote user research to understand problem areas from user’s side. We were short on time, therefore we interviewed 7 users from rural and urban areas of India. This provided valuable insights to our previously synthesised
        assumptions. Few of our assumptions such as ‘problem in filling first two primary address fields’ received mixed

        After all primary research, I created scenarios to get better understanding of problems uncovered in research. This also helped us in prioritising problems and take better decisions on which problem to solve given time and technical constraints.

        <p class="project-text-para">
          After research, I came back to ‘address capture page’ but now with better understanding of its relation and impact throughout order fulfilment lifecycle. I saw two possible approaches that can be taken to design experience for optimising user experience
          First was to start from top to bottom, that is, to think of the best experience for user to tell us where to deliver his/her order and then we figure out how to achieve considering current technological advancements. Second was to start from
          ground up, that is, to pick up problems and make incremental changes to the existing system. “to start designing from ground up or top down.”

        Towards Solution
      </div>
      <div class="process_text">
        <p class="project-text-para">
          For the first approach, we defined our best experience as
        </p>
          <p class="text-focus">‘If we can create a system where user just have to verify the address automatically captured by system’</p>
          <p class="project-text-para">It was not possible because of technological constraints such as inaccuracy of GPS, non-availability of any location capturing method in web browsers.<br>
            Therefore I started going through different technologies for web browsers that can get us as close as possible for creating this type of system. Browser geolocation was one of them. It allows browser to access user’s current location after taking permission from user.<br>
            Alongside, I worked onto improving existing system as well. We decided to tap into following problems:<br>
            1. “Address form is so big to fill”<br>
            2. “I am not sure about my Pincode” <br>
            As Amazon heavily relies on pincode for delivery and incorrect ones leads to tremendous losses, it makes sense to make pincode necessary.<br><br>

            We tried to link pincode with city and state a user is entering but that would be difficult as there can be many variations of same name.
            For eg. ‘Guwahati’, ‘Gauhati’, ‘Guahati’, ‘Guwhati’.<br>
            Therefore we linked ‘City’ and ‘State’ field to pincode instead.

        It was an amazing and fruitful experience working at Amazon. As this was my first B2C project which has massive user base, I learnt a lot of things:
        <ul>
          <li>This project taught me about the magnitude of research and validations required for coming out with changes.</li>
          <li>Projects with massive users are not directly released. They are released to a certain percentage of users and their data is analysed. If data matches to success metrics, then the changes are rolled out to all users.</li>
          <li>How design decisions are measured with ROI.</li>
